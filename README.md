#Vagrant - or - how to code in your local computer
This project demonstrates how to use vagrant with virtual machines

##How to install a VM
Choose a virtualization technology: There are several virtualization technologies available, such as VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V, and others. Choose the virtualization technology that meets your needs and requirements.

Download and install the virtualization software: Visit the website of the virtualization technology you have chosen and download the software. Follow the instructions provided by the software vendor to install the software on your computer.

Create a new virtual machine: After installing the virtualization software, launch it and create a new virtual machine. You will need to specify the operating system type, the amount of memory and disk space to allocate to the virtual machine, and other details.

Install the operating system: Once the virtual machine is created, you need to install the operating system. To do this, you will need to provide the operating system installation media, such as a DVD or ISO file.

Configure the virtual machine: After the operating system is installed, you can configure the virtual machine as needed. This may include installing additional software, setting up network connections, and making other adjustments.

Start the virtual machine: Once the virtual machine is configured, you can start it. You will be able to interact with the virtual machine just as you would with a physical computer.


##How to use VMs with vagrant

Install Vagrant and a virtualization technology like VirtualBox.

Create a Vagrantfile that describes the virtual environment you want to create.

Use the vagrant up command to start the virtual environment.

Use the vagrant ssh command to log in to the virtual environment.

Use the vagrant halt command to stop the virtual environment.
